How do I terminate my software license contract?

License termination rules vary depending on the software: Passport Advantage SW licenses are pre-paid one time charge and they do not require cancellation. Auto-renewal of these contracts will be automatically cancelled after 59 days if no payment is received.

Recurring monthly licenses: Please advise us online of cancellation requirement and include:
Customer number
Name
Phone number
E-mail address
Request for discontinuance

IMPORTANT: ALL copies of Software must be destroyed per cancellation process and confirmation of this must be included in the notification.

You are required to provide 30 day notification unless your installed machine has also been removed from use.

Please submit an online request quoting your contract number and your contact details.

IMPORTANT: You'll find the termination rules for canceling maintenance coverage on your equipment here, and those for software licenses.

What are the termination rules for canceling maintenance coverage on my equipment?

You may terminate standard maintenance services for a machine on one month's notice to us if it has been on maintenance for at least 6 months. Non-standard maintenance addendums can have additional terms and conditions for termination of equipment.

We may terminate maintenance services for a machine on three months' written notice, provided it has been under maintenance services for at least one year. Either of us may terminate service for any Machine if the other does not meet its obligation concerning maintenance services.
